# React Hook - Weather request case
This is a personal project to study React Hook, its operation and its code reading cycles.

My intention here is to understand how `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` works among other tools that React Hook offers.

## Dependencies
- For the weather information I am using the AccuWeather API.
- For the css I'm using the Bootstrap and, for personal preference, I'm using flex to organize the application
